### [Deep learning with convolutional neural networks for brain mapping and decoding of movement-related information from the human EEG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05051.pdf)
* Visualizing EEG data using a variety of Deep Networks
* Did not find huge improvements over existing methods (filter bank common spatial patterns, FBCSP) but might be because of the size of datasets, or features might not have enough hierarchical structure that ConvNets could exploit
* Helped by using dropout, batch normalization, and exponential linear units
* Didn't use handcrafted features
* Largely about the potential of ConvNets for EEG-based brain mapping
